  tea, if that's your thing). It's not mandatory, but it's a nice gesture that
  helps fuel the creation of more open-source goodness.

* This Software is intended for good, not evil. Please don't use it to build
  a robot army bent on world domination. Let's keep things friendly, shall we?

  happy to chat about code and other nerdy things.
